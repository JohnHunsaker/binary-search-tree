## Gameplay
* Player 1 will be prompted to enter a secret word without spaces.
* Player 2 will be repeatedly prompted to guess a letter, and after each guess, the game will congratulate the player on guessing a correct letter, or say that the guess is incorrect and a part has been added.
* If Player 2 guesses the word before using up all attempts, they win. Otherwise, they lose.
